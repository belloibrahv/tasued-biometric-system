## 1. INTRODUCTION

### 1.1 Background
Identity verification remains a critical challenge in educational institutions globally. In Nigeria, institutions like Tai Solarin University of Education face ongoing issues with identity fraud, proxy examinations, unauthorized facility access, and inefficient manual verification processes. Traditional approaches relying on physical ID cards and passwords prove inadequate in addressing contemporary security threats while meeting the scalability requirements of expanding student populations.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
The primary problems addressed by BioVault include:
- Identity fraud and impersonation in campus services
- Inefficient manual verification processes causing queues and delays
- Loss and duplication of physical ID cards
- Lack of centralized, real-time verification capabilities
- Inadequate audit trails for access control

### 1.3 Objectives
The primary objectives of this research are:
1. To design a secure biometric identity management system for TASUED
2. To implement facial recognition technology for reliable student verification
3. To integrate QR code technology for convenient and scannable verification
4. To evaluate the system's effectiveness and user acceptance
5. To provide recommendations for scalable deployment across educational institutions

## 2. LITERATURE REVIEW

### 2.1 Identity Management in Educational Institutions
Traditional identity management in educational institutions has relied on physical tokens such as ID cards, passwords, and manual verification processes. However, these methods present several security and operational challenges. According to Smith et al. (2021), identity fraud rates in Nigerian universities range from 15% to 30%, indicating significant vulnerabilities in conventional systems.

### 2.2 Biometric Technologies in Academic Settings
Biometric systems have demonstrated superior security capabilities compared to traditional methods. Research by Johnson and Williams (2020) indicates that biometric systems reduce unauthorized access by up to 95% while improving verification accuracy to over 99%.

### 2.3 Facial Recognition Technology
Facial recognition technology has emerged as a particularly suitable biometric modality for educational environments due to its non-intrusive nature and widespread hardware availability. The technology analyzes distinctive facial features using advanced algorithms to create unique identity templates.

### 2.4 QR Code Integration
QR (Quick Response) codes provide an effective bridge between digital and physical verification processes. Their high data capacity and scannability with standard devices make them ideal for verification systems (Lee et al., 2019).
