## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background of Study

Identity verification remains a critical challenge in educational institutions worldwide. Traditional identification methods relying on physical ID cards have proven inadequate for meeting the security requirements of modern educational systems. These conventional methods are susceptible to counterfeiting, loss, theft, and unauthorized sharing, leading to significant security vulnerabilities.

Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED), established in 2005 as Nigeria's premier teacher education institution, has experienced substantial growth from an initial enrollment of approximately 2,000 students to over 15,000 students across multiple colleges and departments. This growth has created pressing needs for efficient, secure, and scalable identity management solutions.

BioVault was developed as a Net-Centric Computing project (CSC 415) to address these challenges through a web-based biometric identity management system. The system leverages modern web technologies and biometric verification to provide a comprehensive solution for student identity management across all university services.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

TASUED faces several identity management challenges:

1. **Identity Fraud**: Physical ID cards can be easily counterfeited, shared, or misused, enabling proxy attendance and unauthorized access to facilities.

2. **Verification Inefficiency**: Manual verification processes create long queues at high-traffic locations such as libraries, examination halls, and hostel gates.

3. **Card Management Issues**: Physical ID cards are frequently lost, damaged, or forgotten, requiring costly replacement procedures.

4. **Fragmented Systems**: Different campus services maintain separate verification systems, creating inconsistency and administrative overhead.

5. **Limited Audit Capability**: Traditional systems lack comprehensive logging, making it difficult to track access patterns and investigate security incidents.

6. **Scalability Constraints**: Existing systems struggle to accommodate the growing student population efficiently.

2. User enrolls biometric data (facial capture)
3. System generates encrypted facial template
4. User receives dynamic QR code for verification
5. Operators scan QR code to verify identity
6. Optional facial verification for high-security services

### 3.4 Role-Based Access Control

The system implements three primary roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| STUDENT | View dashboard, generate QR code, view history, manage profile |
| OPERATOR | Scan QR codes, verify students, manage service entry/exit, record attendance |
| ADMIN | Manage users, configure services, view audit logs, generate reports |

### 3.5 QR Code System Design

BioVault generates dynamic QR codes with the following characteristics:

- **Format**: URL pointing to public verification endpoint
- **Content**: `https://tasued-biometric-system.vercel.app/verify/{code}`
- **Expiration**: 5 minutes (configurable)
- **Security**: Unique code per generation, usage tracking, automatic refresh

When scanned by any QR code reader, the URL opens a public verification page displaying:
- Student photo (if available)
- Full name and matric number
- Department and level
- Biometric enrollment status
- QR code validity information

### 3.6 Biometric Processing Pipeline

The facial recognition system follows this pipeline:

1. **Image Capture**: Webcam captures facial image via browser API
2. **Face Detection**: Haar cascade classifier locates face in image
3. **Feature Extraction**: Neural network extracts 128-dimensional embedding
4. **Template Encryption**: AES-256 encrypts the embedding vector
5. **Storage**: Encrypted template stored in database
6. **Verification**: Cosine similarity comparison with threshold of 0.7

```
Cosine Similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)

Where:
- A = Stored facial embedding (128 dimensions)
- B = Captured facial embedding (128 dimensions)
- Threshold = 0.7 (70% similarity required for match)
```
